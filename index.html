	<h1>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h1>
	<img align="right" src="images/alarm.jpg" width="307" height="450" alt="Будильник">
	
		<p>If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
		you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
		enemy - "Time Wasting".</p>

		<p><strong>What you need to know is that "Time Is Money"</strong>. And this
			applies even more to the online world, than in regular
			business.</p>	
		<p><em>You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
			doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
			start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.</em></p>

		<p>And since cash isn't really a barrier, time-management has
			become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
			simply to get more done - in less time.</p>

		<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can
			you do to avoid them?</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
				<li>Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
				<li>Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
				<li>Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
			</ol>

		<p>This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
			retype the same old simple information.</p>

		<p>Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
			signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
			communicating words quickly.</p>

		<p>Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
			enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
			having to type the same thing twice.</p>

		<p>I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
			there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
			available.</p>
	<h6 class="new">Failing to manage your email effectively.</h3>
		<p>I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
			be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
			own installed on your computer.</p>

		<p>i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
			set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
			trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
			emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
			into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
			through them afterwards and pull back any that have
			been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.</p>

			<p>ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
				organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
				FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.</p>
